## Possible Issues / Fixes

### Free Diskspace in HAOS smaller than expected
Sometimes backups created by HAOS are not pruned automatically. Most of the times you can only see it because of the ./backup folder is very big, while in the HA interface you wont see any stored backups.  
Resolve the issue:  
- Install Terminal & SSH addon in HA
- Install SMB addon in HA
- Start the addon, and open the terminal
- first change directory to root: 'cd ..'
- than list the underlaying folders with the command: 'du -hs -d 1'
- take a look at the list of folders and sizes
- if your ./backup folder is greater than 0, and you dont see any backups in HA

In the example you see the ./backup folder is over 20gb ......but .......

im HA we don't see any backups listed ......but .......

If we open the SMB share from HA in the folder Backups we do see a left-over created backup.
- We can delete the backup via SMB, and the diskspace will be freeed to HA
